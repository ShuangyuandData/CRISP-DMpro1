Motivation:
The first formal data science process 
The project is the first exercise project in my journey tp Data Science.
It contains three code files for now indicating three steps for the Cross Industry Process for Data Mining.

Descriptions of files:
1. Data files:
  boscalendar.csv
  boslistings.csv
  bosreviews.csv
2. Main code files:
  Pro1-Airbnb-step1.ipynb
  Pro1-Airbnb-step2.ipynb
  Pro1-Airbnb-step3.ipynb
3. Auxilary code files:
  attach1.py
  attach2.py

4. README.md

Summary:
  1. What is the most popular method when people verify their decision in airbnb?
    The top three methods are phone, email, and reviews.
  2. Where can you rent an Airbnb room with the best price?
    The average highest prices in Boston are in the following areas: Leather district, Chinatown, Back Bay, Downtown, and South Boston Waterfront. The average lowest prices in Boston are in Roslindale, Hyde Park, and Mattapan. Remember, the lowest price is not always the best price.
